# Taylors Bio (homework 2)

## Description 
 This website includes a section about my background, some fun facts about me, photos of my some important people in my life, and my contact information. On my main page (Home aka index.html) I mostly talked about my time in Mexico because that was a unique few months of my life. I included a few fun facts about me to give you more insight into my life outside of Mexico. 
 On my Portfolio page, I have some photos of my favorite people (and dog). The first photo is of my boyfriend, Jackson, and I, and the second photo was taken in San Diego with Karsen, Madeline and Chongo (the dog). You can then see me diving in a cenote, another photo of Jackson and I when it snowed in September in Denver, CO. Then you'll see two photos of our dog, Osa, and below that is Karsen and I, then Madeline, Luke and I.
 My contact page allows you contact me about any questions you may have. I also have included the links to my social media websites and my email information.

## Installation
  Fork all of the files over to your own GitHub to make changes. (still not sure what this portion is)
  
## Usage
  Instructions are not needed for this webpage (still not sure what this portion is)

## Technologies Used
 To create these pages, I mainly used BootStrap. I did use a small amount of JavaScript for my navagation bars, so the JavaScript links are towards the bottom of each html page. 
 I created many different columns and rows throughout my documents, and these change based on the browser size. If you are viewing on a mobile phone, the navagation bar will be a dropdown menu, but if you are viewing on a tablet or desktop in full screen, the navagation bar will be placed at the top with direct links-no dropdown menu.
 I used GoogleFonts for the fonts on all three pages- the Home and Portfolio pages are styled in "Roboto", while the contact page is styled in "Roboto Mono"
 
## Problems I faced
  It was unclear to me that I had to link my JavaScript into my html pages, so it took awhile to get my NavBar working in mobile view. Once that was linked, I was able to use my NavBar in every view. 
  On my index, or Home, page, I am unsure if my image is too big but instead of my columns adding up to twelve, they only add up to 10 (3,4,3) otherwise the last column would shift down below my first column. This could probably be fixed if I resized my image, but I like the size of it so we will leave two columns blank.
  Both of my email links do not open a website link into a "New Message", but the emails are referenced there for a simple copy and paste.
  
 ## Credits
  Most of the credit goes to my Professor, Gary and the two TA's Leo and Maria.
  I also had some help from my classmates (Jessica, Tessa, Ryan and Andy).
