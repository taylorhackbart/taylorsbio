# Taylors Bio (homework 2)

## Description 
 This website includes a section about my background, some fun facts about me, projects I have worked on, and my contact information. On my main page (Home aka index.html) I mostly talked about my time in Mexico because that was a unique few months of my life. I included a few fun facts about me to give you more insight into my life outside of Mexico. 
 On my Portfolio page, I have a few projects that we have worked on in class. I chose our "Let's Hit the Slopes" because it includes different APIs we used. The random password generator was a fun project to work on because it was te beginning of using functions and alerts to generate outcomes. The day planner used primarily javascript to generate the page and used local storage. I included a link to my resume at the bottom, but this will be updated to a tech resume as the course continues.
 My contact page includes the links to my LinkedIn and GitHub sites, and my email information.

## Installation
  Fork all of the files over to your own GitHub to make changes.
  
## Usage
  Instructions are not needed for this webpage

## Technologies Used
 To create these pages, I mainly used BootStrap. I did use a small amount of JavaScript for my navigation bars, so the JavaScript links are towards the bottom of each html page. 
 I created many different columns and rows throughout my documents, and these change based on the browser size. If you are viewing on a mobile phone, the navigation bar will be a dropdown menu, but if you are viewing on a tablet or desktop in full screen, the navigation bar will be placed at the top with direct links-no dropdown menu.
 I used GoogleFonts for the fonts on all three pages styled in "Roboto".
 
## Problems I faced
  It was unclear to me that I had to link my JavaScript into my html pages, so it took awhile to get my NavBar working in mobile view. Once that was linked, I was able to use my NavBar in every view. 
  On my index, or Home, page, I am unsure if my image is too big but instead of my columns adding up to twelve, they only add up to 10 (3,4,3) otherwise the last column would shift down below my first column. This could probably be fixed if I resized my image, but I like the size of it so we will leave two columns blank.
  Both of my email links do not open a website link into a "New Message", but the emails are referenced there for a simple copy and paste.
  The "Search" button in my NavBar does not work, neither actually entering any info on the "Contact" page- haven't learned how to do that yet.
  
 ## Credits
  Most of the credit goes to my Professor, Gary and the two TA's Leo and Maria.
  I also had some help from my classmates (Jessica, Tessa, Ryan and Andy).
